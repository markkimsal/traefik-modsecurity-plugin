# Traefik Modsecurity Plugin

![Banner](./img/banner.png)

this is a fork of a fork:
  *  the original: https://github.com/acouvreur/traefik-modsecurity-plugin
  *  the fork: https://github.com/madebymode/traefik-modsecurity-plugin


MxM fork: This fork introduces alpine images, CRS 4.x suppport, a custom http.transport, and a 429 jail for repeat offenders

This fork:
  * HTTP keep-alive to WAF server
  * ignore WAF network failures
  * remove dummy back-end from CRS (perf improvement)

## Demo

Demo with WAF intercepting relative access in query param.

![Demo](./img/waf.gif)

## Usage (docker-compose.yml)

See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

1. docker-compose up
2. Go to http://localhost/website, the request is received without warnings
3. Go to http://localhost/website?test=../etc, the request is intercepted and returned with 403 Forbidden by
   owasp/modsecurity
4. You can you bypass the WAF and check attacks at http://localhost/bypass?test=../etc

## How it works

This is a very simple plugin that proxies the query to the owasp/modsecurity apache container.

The plugin checks that the response from the waf container hasn't an http code > 400 before forwarding the request to
the real service.

If it is > 400, then the error page is returned instead.

The *dummy* service is created so the waf container forward the request to a service and respond with 200 OK all the
time.

## Configuration

This plugin supports these configuration:

* `modSecurityUrl`: (**mandatory**) it's the URL for the owasp/modsecurity container.
* `timeoutMillis`: (optional) timeout in milliseconds for the http client to talk with modsecurity container. (default 2
  seconds)
* `jailEnabled`:  (optional) 429 jail for repeat offenders (based on threshold settings)
* `JailTimeDurationSecs`:  (optional) how long a client will be jailed for, in seconds
* `badRequestsThresholdCount`: (optional) # of 403s a clientIP can trigger from OWASP before being adding to jail
* `badRequestsThresholdPeriodSecs` (optional) # the period, in seconds, that the threshold must meet before a client is added to the 429 jail

## Local development (docker-compose.local.yml)

See [docker-compose.local.yml](docker-compose.local.yml)

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up` to load the local plugin
